- **Main Findings**:
  - The capacity to generate adaptive variation can evolve by natural selection; using experimental bacterial populations of *Pseudomonas fluorescens*, the authors report the evolution of enhanced evolvability via localised hyper-mutation.
  - A lineage-level birth-death dynamic, where lineage success depended on the capacity to mutate between two phenotypic states (cel+ and cel-), each optimal in a cycling environment, was key to realising evolvability.
  - The evolved mechanism is analogous to "contingency loci" in pathogenic bacteria, whose evolutionary origin was previously unclear. The study provides a detailed mechanistic account of how such loci can arise.
  - In one meta-population, localised hyper-mutability arose through expansion and contraction of a heptanucleotide (hn) repeat sequence (GGTGCCC) in the regulatory gene *pflu0185*, enabling rapid phenotypic switching without elevating the global mutation rate.
  - Transcription-associated mutagenesis played a potentiating role: a series of mutations ratcheted up transcription of *pflu0185* approximately 30-fold, which indirectly increased the rate of slipped-strand mispairing at the hn-repeat, elevating the local frameshift rate by over four orders of magnitude.
  - Under more stringent selection (reduced population size and 24-hour switching requirement), lineages rapidly expanded hn-repeat copy number from 1 to up to 16 additional copies, demonstrating that the locus itself is highly evolvable with respect to the frequency of environmental change.
  - Lineages with localised hyper-mutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive secondary mutations (e.g., in chemotaxis and motility genes such as *aer*, *fleQ*, *fleN*), because early and reliable phenotypic switching provided a "head start" for secondary mutations to reach high frequency.
  - The results demonstrate that lineage-level selection can incorporate prior evolutionary history into the genetic architecture of a single cell, such that mutation appears to anticipate future environmental change.
